Somehow I decided to move the T_ColorChooser class from T_Algorithms and not put it anywhere else.  I found an old copy of the file (from 2002) and included it in the T_Beans project.  Unfortunately I do not have the .form copy so I can no longer edit the GUI - which has spacing problems.
The current Teds Toolbox build will work, but the color changing from has GUI spacing issues.  Also, the Set button is not hooked up.
Unless there is time to update the set event, I'd recommend removing the color chooser frame.  Doesn't really fit anyway In the Ted's toolbox anyway.
